# MobileScreenCodeTest
This is a code test I've done in order to show of my understanding of unit testing, browser testing, backend API development with Laravel and frontend scraffolding with ReactJS. Simple as it may be it was made in a few days (on my spare time) as an example and not meant to be a full fledged solution but rather serve the purpose of demonstration.
